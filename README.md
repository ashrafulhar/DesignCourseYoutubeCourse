Learning Design Course Youtube Course

This repo is a test for my understanding of using git.
It is going to be a purpose to practice how to use git.

All the codes that is found in the HTML and CSS is a course that I am currently doing from YouTube.
I am tryting to pursue and increase my knowledge for Web Development.

Update of 29th June

The course from using youtube is completed.
What did I manage to get out of this.

The understading of how to actually use HTML, css and Javascript to create a website from a UI/UX designer.
Yes this wasn't a code that I've created my self. but it is something that I can learn from.
Another thing is, that this is my first time using Git.
